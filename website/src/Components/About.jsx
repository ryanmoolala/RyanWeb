                        Hi, I'm Ryan! Curious and analytical, I've always been keen to learn. From a young age, my interest in technology blossomed. Driven by a passion for problem-solving, I chose computer science as my major â€“ a decision that feels absolutely right to me. As I tinker with programming languages and delve into the transformative power of technology in the modern world, my aspiration is to pursue this field of study and contribute to positive change.
